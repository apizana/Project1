Project Description/Outline:
We will compare United States suicide rates to potential contributing factors. Then we
will attempt to determine which contributing factors are more pertinent to suicide rates
and which factors could be improved upon to help lower the overall suicide rates of the
United States.

Research Questions to answer:
How are the US suicide rates compared to the World for the last 5 years?
What is the biggest contributor to suicide? GDP, work/life balance, physical health,
mental health?
What are methods that can be implemented to improve suicide rates?


Hypothesis
Hypothesis: If we adjust gun accessibility, the rate of suicide will decrease by 2%.â€‹
Null Hypothesis : Changing the access to guns the suicide rate will have no effect.
