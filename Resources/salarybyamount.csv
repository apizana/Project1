This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.

Approximately 68,000 addresses were eligible to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC and the remaining 30,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned income questions.

"24 Beginning with the 2003 CPS ASEC, respondents were allowed to choose one or more races. White alone refers to people who reported White and did not report any other race category. The use of this single-race population does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing the data. The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being Hispanic was reported by 16.0 percent of White householders who reported only one race, 5.3 percent of Black householders who reported only one race, and 2.7 percent of Asian householders who reported only one race. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population and for race groups because these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and recency of immigration. Data were first collected for Hispanics in 1972.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
